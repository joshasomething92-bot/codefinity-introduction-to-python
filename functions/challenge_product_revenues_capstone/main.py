# Task 1: Define a function to calculate the revenue for each product
def calculate_revenue(prices, quantities_sold):
    # Initialize a list to store the calculated revenues

    # Iterate through the `prices` and `quantities_sold` lists using indexing
    for index in range(len(prices)):
        # Append the revenue (price * quantity) for each product to the revenue list
        revenue.append(prices[index] * quantities_sold[index])
    
    # Return the list of revenues
    return revenue

# Task 2: Define a function to format and display the sorted revenues

# Task 3: Call the `calculate_revenue()` function to get total `revenue` for each product
revenue = calculate_revenue(prices, quantities_sold)

# Task 4: Use `zip()` to combine the products and their corresponding revenues into a list
revenue_per_product = list(zip(products, revenue))

# Task 5: Display the sorted revenues using the `formatted_output()` function
formatted_output(revenue_per_product)
